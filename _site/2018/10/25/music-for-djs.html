  <p>This is a dump of the notes I took during a DJ seminar given by a well respected west coast DJ several years ago. I hope to come back and clean them up, but here they are as they were written.</p>

<h1>Class One - Musical Quality</h1>

<h3>Positioning of the beat Emphasis</h3>

<p>End (like the bando) vs beginning (piano)
Emphasis of the beat can be used to build families of tango sounds
x = energy, y = rythm</p>

<p>Street band</p>

<ul>
<li>Centered emphasis</li>
<li>Loose, sweet feeling</li>
<li>Canaro, Victor, Lomuto</li>
<li><em>El Adios (Canaro) for example</em></li>
</ul>


<p>Driving</p>

<ul>
<li>Forward emphasis</li>
<li>Feels pushy, tight, angry</li>
<li>DArienzo, Biagi, some Troilo</li>
</ul>


<p>Refined</p>

<ul>
<li>Rear emphasis</li>
<li>Feels laggy, elegant, and melancholy</li>
<li>DAgostino, Di Sarli, Fresedo</li>
</ul>


<p>Exploratory</p>

<ul>
<li>Extremely late emphasis</li>
<li>Stretchy, virutosic, angsty</li>
<li>De Caro, Pugliese, some Laurenz</li>
</ul>


<h4>The Backbone</h4>

<p>Calo: Refined<br/>
DiSarli: Centered<br/>
Troilo: Driving, Exploratory<br/>
Pugliese: Exploratoy<br/>
DArienzo: Driving<br/>
Canaro: Street Band</p>

<h4>Side Players</h4>

<p>DAgostino<br/>
De caro<br/>
Biagi<br/>
Rodriguez<br/>
Lomuto<br/>
Fresedo<br/>
DAngelis: hard to place, sometimes multiple styles even in same song<br/>
Demare: Refined, Exploratory</p>

<h3>Equipment</h3>

<h4>Speaker positioning</h4>

<p>Speakers should be above head height <br/>
Should be along the long end of the floor so sound is distributed<br/>
Pointed slightly in</p>

<h4>Mixer</h4>

<p>Keep your sound levels all below 75% (source? Research this)<br/>
Make sure bass isnâ€™t turned up</p>

<h4>Volume</h4>

<p>Check volume on floor frequently<br/>
Before you start, check for loud or quiet areas<br/>
Watch number of dancers, sound will be muffled if there are a lot of dancers</p>

<h4>Equalizer</h4>

<p>Many of the pops and scratches on are on the higher frequencies<br/>
Most of the song data is in the midranges</p>

<h1>Class Two - Music and Space</h1>

<h3>Last week's topics</h3>

<ul>
<li>where the emphasis lies on the beat</li>
<li>mapping the orchestras</li>
<li>talked about emotional content linked to type of sound</li>
<li>key instruments

<ul>
<li>streetband - bass, low tones of violins, focus on keeping the beat</li>
<li>exploratory - bando</li>
<li>refined - piano</li>
<li>driving - bando(?)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<h3>How to put these classifiers to work</h3>

<p>Group songs with a similar sound so dancers know what they can expect.
Dancers can pair based on what emotion they want to express given the theme of the tanda.</p>

<h3>The Role of the DJ</h3>

<p>To help the dancers express the music.<br/>
To have them leave the floor feeling confident.<br/>
Keeping a balance so that everyone has something to dance to.<br/>
Sequencing the songs in a way that flows and feels sensible.<br/>
To bring them through key musical areas so they feel the entire range of "the milonga experience". <br/>
To keep the early dancers happy even while warming up the dancers who arrive later.</p>

<h3>Thinking about the tanda</h3>

<p>A song is the atomic unit.<br/>
A tanda is the molecule.<br/>
Each atom has a specific feeling to contribute to the molecule.<br/>
The tanda should elicit a specific feeling which grows and progresses from song 1 to 4.<br/>
Each tanda needs to fit the flow of the night, blending smoothly from the previous one and into the next.</p>

<h3>Tanda Skeleton</h3>

<p><strong>Song 1</strong><br/>
Very familiar / well known<br/>
Draws dancers to the floor<br/>
<em>El Cencerro</em><br/>
<em>Pensalo Bien</em><br/>
<em>Tristeza Marina</em><br/>
<em>Vamos</em><br/>
<em>Araca La Cana</em><br/>
<em>Adios Buenos Aires</em></p>

<p><strong>Song 2</strong><br/>
Well known, almost on par with song 1<br/>
Danceable but not appropriate for beginning or ending<br/>
<em>Gorriones</em><br/>
<em>Caero Al As</em><br/>
<em>Sencillo y Compadre</em></p>

<p><strong>Song 3</strong><br/>
Less familiar, good place to experiment (slightly)<br/>
Continues or revises direction<br/>
Higher energy than song 2</p>

<p><strong>Song 4</strong><br/>
Also very familiar
Highest energy<br/>
Has a strong ending, can feature a varacion or a nice vocal<br/>
Makes them feel confidence and lets them express their emotion  <br/>
<em>El Recodo (might be a good opener, but too powerful, nothing could go up from here)</em><br/>
<em>Dime Mi Amor (voice at the end is nice)</em><br/>
<em>La Capilla Blanca (slow down at the end doesn't affect any "next song")</em><br/>
<em>Patetico (nice variacion)</em></p>

<h3>Things to think about</h3>

<ul>
<li>The start and the end are the most important, people remember these

<ul>
<li>primacy and recency effect in psychology</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Familiarity and variety should be balanced

<ul>
<li>too many familiar songs is boring and tired</li>
<li>too much variety is bothersome, even if all the songs are danceable</li>
<li>the middle of the set is a good place to introduce less known music</li>
<li>listening to your collection TOO MUCH may throw off your feeling of what is familiar within the community</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Guide the change in energy within the tanda

<ul>
<li>should travel in a specific direction - the goal of the tanda</li>
<li>the intensity of the direction should increase over the tanda, not fall</li>
<li>direction can be romance, intensity, virtuosity, etc</li>
<li>does not ALL need to be moving upward, but last two should</li>
<li>could go down on the second song (forms a checkmark shape)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Don't get in the way of the tanda being danceable just to explore as a DJ</li>
<li>Don't leave a slow ending on a song in the middle, it will interfere with the next song's energy</li>
<li>Same singer &amp; orchestra is usually best

<ul>
<li>changing will alert some dancers, taking them out of the moment</li>
<li>can change orchestras if there's a very specific reason</li>
<li>can mix instrumental / vocal (vocal often has higher intensity)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Varacion usually in Song 4 but can be in others if they feel right</li>
<li>Watch out for songs involving soccor in the lyrics, can be distracting to spanish speakers</li>
</ul>


<h2>The SuperTanda</h2>

<p>The molecular chain<br/>
TTM or TTV - As a unit, lower energy tango to higher energy tango</p>

<h2>Space - The Ronda</h2>

<p>Rectangle provides opportunity for different movement based on side length<br/>
Square can feel more consistent to some dancers<br/>
Permeate tables to allow more entry / exit points</p>

<h2>How to watch the room</h2>

<p>Blur your vision and perceive the flow, are there big gaps or concentrations?<br/>
If people are focused on specific musical elements or movements too much, it suggests they aren't feeling the music and their partner enough.<br/>
D'Arienzo: forces them to adhere to the beat<br/>
Pugliese / Podesta: allows them to focus inward and on each other<br/>
Watch for temperature<br/>
<em>If the room is hot, don't make them move enough to heat it up more</em><br/>
<em>If the room is cold, make them move around and warm it up</em></p>

<hr />

<h2>Homework for Class 3</h2>

<p>Choose 3 songs that represent tandas
Build a SuperTanda and justify it (TTM or TTV)</p>

<hr />

<h1>Class Three - The Supertanda</h1>

<p>Example tanda - builds rythmic intensity<br/>
<em>Dejame Ser Asi - Llorar por una mujer - Danza Maligna - En la buena y la mala</em></p>

<p>Example tanda - builds melodic emotional intensity<br/>
<em>Tristeza Marina - Decime que paso - Charlemos - Griseta</em></p>

<p>Bad Example tanda - nice songs but doesn't feel like it progresses<br/>
<em>A Quien La Puede Importar - Esta Noche en Buenos Aires - Gorriones - El Yacare</em></p>

<p>Bad Example tanda - "wakes up" the dancers<br/>
<em>Santa Milonguita - Trago Amargo - Infamia - Dime mi amor</em></p>

<ul>
<li>Switches singer, recodring quality, pianist</li>
<li>This is ok to do as long as the voices are similar</li>
<li>Tanturri, Troilo, Di Sarli should be left alone</li>
<li>Mixing Beron might be dicey</li>
</ul>


<p><strong>Listen to the first and last song to check that there's a progression</strong></p>

<p><strong>Listen to the entire song, they might get weird halfway in - A Pan y Agua</strong></p>

<h2>Role of the DJ - Revisted</h2>

<p>Facilitate the "milonga experience"<br/>
Curating the experience through the music</p>

<ol>
<li>Drawing dancers to the floor - Grab a sitter and make them dance with you to break the ice</li>
<li>Helping the dancers express the music</li>
<li>Helping them navigate through the night, including the change in skill level as the night progresses - Easy / danceable early - gooey center - touching the musical corners toward the end</li>
<li>Help them feel the music deeply, focusing on an instrument or sound</li>
</ol>


<h4>RULE: Don't get in the way of the dancers, you're a step ahead of them but not controlling them</h4>

<p>Having supertandas built is helpful<br/>
Example: <em>Di Sarli / Rufino -> Laurenz / Casas</em></p>

<h2>Crafting the flow</h2>

<h3>The three flows</h3>

<ol>
<li>Tanda</li>
<li>Supertanda</li>
<li>The entire night</li>
</ol>


<h3>Tools</h3>

<ol>
<li>Sequence of songs and orchestras</li>
<li>Energy reset</li>
<li>Pattern: TTVTTM TTVTM TTTVM

<ul>
<li>Use these to control partner change frequencies</li>
<li>TTVTM will encourage faster rotation</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Palate cleanser: chacarrera / salsa / swing

<ul>
<li>Only a good idea if enough people will actually dance it</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>


<h3>Energy level flow</h3>

<p>Compare a sawtooth energy pattern with a sinusoidal one<br/>
Sawtooth: doesn't allow for pallate cleansers</p>

<p>T1 T3 V5 T2 T4 M6</p>

<h4>TT Pairs</h4>

<p>DiSarli/Rufino -> Laurenz/Casas : Increasing strechiness<br/>
Fresedo -> Troilo : Rythmic playfulness (gentle to more gripping)</p>

<p>Crossing musical families between sets allows you to differentiate the adjacent sets<br/>
Avoid repeating musical familes (Canaro -> OTV would be too much)<br/>
Alternating rythmic melodic within the supertanda covers your dancers tastes better</p>

<p>Think about the thread between tango 1,2 and 4,5</p>

<h4>Range of emotions</h4>

<p>Should be tighter in the beginning for newer dancers or people who just arrived<br/>
Should get wider toward the end to fill more of the milonga experience</p>

<p>Notes:<br/>
Canaro doesn't work pre-milonga, not enough build<br/>
DiSarli/Podesta into a Biagi would be too abrupt<br/>
No vals after a DiSarli/Podesta - they're too swirly and round (abrupt)</p>

<h4>Cortinas</h4>

<p>They should inspire motion, but in a vague way - Don't suggest swing / salsa<br/>
Should follow the previous tanda to prevent ruining the embrace-feeling they had<br/>
Length based on how long it will take the floor to clear (20s - 70s)C</p>

<h4>Changing the pattern</h4>

<p>Last 30 minutes, or some defining point, she stops playing milongas and valses, just varies the energy levels of tangos<br/>
Reduces rotation and enhances flow</p>

<h2>Ending notes</h2>

<p>Disabling trackpad-touch-to-click or bringing a mouse<br/>
Build double the sets you need for the time<br/>
Mixing - Saca chispas only good decaro milonga, has to be mixed with others<br/>
Tanda placards - nice but if you use them make sure you actually use them</p>
