  <p class="lead">Rock climbing</p>


<p>My first time top roping in a long time. We went to Mission Cliffs where I <em>almost</em> aced the belay test. I forgot how to check my double figure eight knot (look for 5 sets of parallel lines). I climbed some 5.10d's and a 5.11a. It was a good wake up call that bouldering focuses on very different strengths.</p>

<p class="lead">A walk</p>


<p>Megan and I walked 9 miles in one day. We hit Buena Vista, Corona Heights, and Sutro Open Space Preserve. I was fortunate enough to have Apple Pay set up on my phone so we could buy something to drink in Cole Valley, as I forgot my wallet.</p>

<p class="lead">Reading Kafka</p>


<p>I borrowed <em>The Trial</em>, by F. Kafka, from my friend George. I was surprised to have covered 70 pages in one day (the book is ~250). I've been mixing paperback (Hillbilly Elegy) and Kindle books (The Innovator's Dilemma) recently. Each format has different qualities to appreciate.</p>
