<p>We drove into Death Valley in a rented Jeep, with two friends in the back, and 2 more in their own truck (an FJ).</p>

Megan kept us happy with her ukelele on the way through Tahoe. From there we headed down along past Mono Lake and eventually into the valley.</p>

We hiked in this canyon on the last day before heading out. We got back out just as rain started coming down -- something we didn't want to be in the canyon for.</p>
