<p>In November of 2016 we decided to go to Death Valley for Thanksgiving. For the past few years we had been going to a tango festival up in Oregon, but it was canceled. Good time to try something new.</p>

<p class="lead">First day - Hot Springs</p>


<p>We rented a rented Jeep, picked up two of our traveler friends, and met up with two more who were in their own truck (a Toyota FJ). We headed out of San Francisco towards Tahoe.</p>

Megan kept us happy with her ukelele songs on the way up through Tahoe. From there we headed south, past Topaz and Mono Lakes and eventually into the valley.</p>

<p>We slept near some hot springs that we enjoyed before bedtime. The air was probably in the upper 20s F by this point, but the water was perfectly warm. We made dinner as the temperature continued dropping. My bag is rated for 30F, so with a low of 7F that night, I was pretty uncomfortable.</p>

<p class="lead">Second day - Into the Valley</p>

As we entered the valley we had to air down our tires for better traction and a softer ride.</p>

Making our way into Saline Valley.</p>

We stopped for lunch near a collection of other people's camping vehicles in Saline Valley. This one demanded its own picture.</p>

<p><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/83326/kylejameskirwan.com_rsources/photography/death_valley/death_valley-7.jpg">
As it was getting dark, we had to decide whether to make camp here, near a salt lake with some strange wood remnants of a cable-drawn bucket system, or head further up toward the Lippincott Mine road. We decided to press on.</p>

<p class="lead">Third day - Mines and the Racetrack</p>


<p>The first thing to tackle today was Lippincott pass. It's a long stretch of uphill road wide enough for one vehicle. The road itself is a pile of tennis ball-sized rocks, so we made use of the 2-speed transfer case on our Jeep, keeping it in "4-lo".</p>

<p><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/83326/kylejameskirwan.com_rsources/photography/death_valley/death_valley-8.jpg">
After we cleared the pass, we had to document our achievement.</p>

<p>From there, we went to examine some abandoned mines!</p>

<p><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/83326/kylejameskirwan.com_rsources/photography/death_valley/death_valley-9.jpg">
We spent a lot of time after the trip identifying this vehicle. I think it was a 1930's Buick. The gear shifter still moved through each gear smoothly (given the condition anyway).</p>

A warning at the entrance to the King Lead mine, at the end of Lippincott Mine road. It reads about snakes, unfired explosives, cave-ins, and how the park rangers will not be saving you.</p>

<p>From the mines, we progressed to Racetrack Playa, a common Death Valley point of interest.</p>

The Grandstand on the Racetrack Playa. It contrasts so heavily with the almost-white and sandless floor of the playa.</p>

The floor of the playa was almost leatherlike. Smooth but firm, with no sand on it at all. It would crack slightly under the pressure of your bare feet.</p>

<p>That night we slept at the most pedestrian site of the trip -- a plain campground near a gift shop and gas station in the valley. To preserve as much of the "outdoorness" as possible, we moved our tents far from the fire ring, in between bunches of shoulder-height sand dunes.</p>

<p class="lead">Last day - A hike before home</p>


<p><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/83326/kylejameskirwan.com_rsources/photography/death_valley/death_valley-14.jpg">
We hiked in this canyon on the last day before heading out. We got back out just as rain started coming down -- something we didn't want to be in the canyon for.</p>

<p><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/83326/kylejameskirwan.com_rsources/photography/death_valley/death_valley-15.jpg">
We wanted to climb the Panamint dunes visble in the lower left of the background, but the detour would've put us back home later than we wanted. We settled for this picture instead.</p>

<p>Death Valley has cemented its place in my list of great locations in California. It's a rewarding trip, especially if you're willing to go down some of the many less traveled roads available.</p>
