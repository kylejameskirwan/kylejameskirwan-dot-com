  <p>The books I've been reading in the last several months, roughly in reverse order of completion.</p>

<p class="lead">Child of God</p>


<p>By Cormac McCarthy. Relatively short but thoroughly enjoyable. The only other McCarthy book I've read was The Road, which was the first book I cried at. This was less crushing, but still felt like watching a car accident happen in slow motion. Themes and imagery are heavy.</p>

<p class="lead">The Innovator's Dilemma</p>


<p>By Clayton Christenson. This was recommended to me by a mentor of mine, who I respect greatly, so it went to the top of my list. It was described to me as "here is my theory, and 15 examples that prove it's true", which sounds like a common theme among business writing. While the description was accurate, the theory proposed was convincing. Even if it isn't correct, it seems like having a flawed framework for dealing with change is better than not having one.</p>

<p class="lead">Structures</p>


<p>By J.E. Gordon. A very approachable explanation of the basic forces behind buildings, bridges, and other structures that we live with daily. I loved the blending of history, physics concepts, simple-enough equations, and humor.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Structures-Things-Dont-Fall-Down/dp/0306812835/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1489995451&sr=8-1&keywords=structures+or+why+things+don%27t+fall+down">Structures on Amazon</a></p>

<p class="lead">Rework</p>


<p>By Jason Fried. An ultra-concise detailing of the practices used at 37 Signals (now Basecamp) for becoming the multi-billion dollar startup they are to...ah nevermind, they're still a small business and like it that way. While the book has ideas that push startups to think about what really matters, and is worth the short read, I'm tired of the 37 Signals "any business who prioritizes growth is stupid" diatribe. The shadow of that bias hung over me while reading it.</p>
