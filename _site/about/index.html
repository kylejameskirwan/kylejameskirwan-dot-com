<p>I use this to recount my travels, dicuss thoughts relevant to my professional work, and show some of my photography. The site is hosted via GitHub Pages, with a domain bought through Hover. I use the <a href="http://github.com/gfjaru/Kiko">Kiko</a> theme for Jekyll.</p>

<p><strong>I live in San Francisco</strong>, having moved here in 2013 from my home state, Florida.</p>

<p>On the suggestion of a close friend who had been living here already, I traded my desktop computer in exchange for the one way ticket, borrowed some money from a friend in Orlando, and slept on an <a href="http://www.ikea.com/us/en/images/products/kivik-chaise-blue__0504255_PE633250_S4.JPG">Ikea Kivik</a> for 2 months while I job hunted. Everything I brought fit into one laptop bag, and one duffel bag.</p>

<p>It's been a real adventure so far, and I'm grateful for the help I got from everyone involved (James, Paul, Andrew, Stubbs, Pudge, ...).</p>

<p><strong>I work at Uber</strong> as a product manager, building internal data tools. I moved into product from data science, which I did here between 2013 and 2016.</p>

<p>Before Uber, I interned at Grooveshark, while doing my undergrad in <a href="http://www.ise.ufl.edu">Industrial and Systems engineering</a> at the University of Florida.</p>

<p><strong>For fun</strong>, I dance <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whnmaF8O_pI">Argentine Tango</a>, dabble in photography (both digital and film), go hiking and camping, and enjoy rock climbing (primarily indoor, both bouldering and top rope).</p>

<p>My girlfriend Megan writes about our travels and adventures over at <a href="https://beautimoose.wordpress.com">her own Wordpress blog</a>.</p>
