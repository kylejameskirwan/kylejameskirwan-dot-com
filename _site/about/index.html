<p>This is my place to recount travels, dicuss thoughts from my professional life, and exhibit some of my photography. The site is hosted via GitHub Pages, with a domain bought through Hover. I use the <a href="http://github.com/gfjaru/Kiko">Kiko</a> theme for Jekyll.</p>

<p><strong>I live in San Francisco.</strong></p>

<p>I moved in 2013 from Florida, on the suggestion of a close friend who had been living here already.</p>

<p>I traded my desktop computer for the one way ticket, borrowed some money from a friend in Orlando, and slept on an <a href="http://www.ikea.com/us/en/images/products/kivik-chaise-blue__0504255_PE633250_S4.JPG">Ikea Kivik</a> for 2 months while I job hunted. My offer letter from Uber arrived on the Wednesday before my budget-imposed last weekend. I will never regret dropping everything and moving with only what could fit in carry-on luggage to somewhere I'd never been before. Maybe I can try it again someday.</p>

<p><strong>I work at Uber.</strong></p>

<p>I'm a product manager in our data org, building internal data tools. Most of my work is focused on improving efficiency for folks who consume data in their own work. I moved to product from data science, which I did here between 2013 and 2016. I'm fortunate to be working with some talented and experience people who I learn from every day.</p>

<p>Prior to Uber, I interned at Grooveshark, while completing undergrad in <a href="http://www.ise.ufl.edu">Industrial and Systems engineering</a> at the University of Florida.</p>

<p><strong>For fun</strong></p>

<p>I dance <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whnmaF8O_pI">Argentine Tango</a>, do amateur photography (digital and film), go hiking and camping, and enjoy rock climbing (primarily indoor, both bouldering and top rope).</p>

<p>My girlfriend Megan writes about our travels and adventures over at <a href="https://beautimoose.wordpress.com">her own Wordpress blog</a>.</p>
