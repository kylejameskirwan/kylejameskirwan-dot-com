  <p>Another list of things I‚Äôd recommend to others (with a few extras from Amy that I haven‚Äôt been to myself). This one is overdue: I lived in San Diego from February to June this year and am only getting around to writing about it now.</p>

<h3 id="fish">Fish</h3>
<p><strong>Musashi‚Äôs (UTC)</strong> (shout out to Jackson, who made every meal feel like visiting family): changed our lives for five months. So so thankful this spot exists. An extension of Musashi‚Äôs Seattle with generous portions of delicious fish for very reasonable prices.<br />
<strong>El Pescador (La Jolla)</strong>: delicious fishes served by people who look like they‚Äôd rather be surfing.<br />
<strong>Suhsi Ota</strong>: very traditional atmosphere and food, well done.<br />
<strong>Himitsu</strong>: non-traditional! Interesting preparations and a nice foil to Ota. Pricey. No tamago ‚òπÔ∏è</p>

<h3 id="coffee-and-tea">Coffee and tea</h3>
<p><strong>Bird Rock (La Jolla) (and downtown)</strong>: A fantastic coffee roaster. Great place to sit and slow down.<br />
<strong>Philz (UTC)</strong>: full of students studying. A Mint Mojito in the afternoon is a good thing. No espresso here.<br />
<strong>Copa Vida (Wesley what up!)</strong>: quieter than Philz, but still mostly students studying.<br />
<strong>Caffe Calabria (North Park)</strong>: Amy went here all the time with Avi for coffee. Pizza good too!<br />
<strong>Cafe Bassam (Balboa Park)</strong>: old world feel</p>

<h3 id="breweries">Breweries</h3>
<p><strong>Stone</strong>: the Disneyland of beer. Seminal location for the craft beer industry.<br />
<strong>Ballast Point</strong>: home of Sculpin, one of my favorite IPAs (as well as some notably delicious stouts).<br />
<strong>Border X Brewing (Barrio Logan)</strong>: nice brews but come for the fantastic tacos in the back. Enjoyed this on an art night when the street was crowded.<br />
<strong>Modern Times</strong>: bustling brewery on weekends with solid beer.</p>

<h3 id="bars">Bars</h3>
<p><strong>Tiger Tiger! (North Park)</strong>: Slightly grungy. Home of the famous Man Hour. Get a beer and a brat (and Raj‚Äôs phone number).<br />
<strong>False Idol (this is Amy‚Äôs suggestion. I never got to go! üò§)</strong>: because any tiki bar with any relation to Martin Cate is a must-do in my book.<br />
<strong>Panama 66 (Balboa Park)</strong>: Outdoor seating, beer and cocktails. There was live jazz just within earshot. Perfect.<br />
<strong>Prohibition</strong>: speakeasy style bar. Because it‚Äôs in the bar/club district, the clientele can be uncivilized (only speakeasy I‚Äôve been to where I overheard someone <em>try</em> to order an appletini), but can be worth a visit.</p>

<h3 id="tacos-ceveche-and-the-like">Tacos, Ceveche, and the like</h3>
<p><strong>Taco Stand (several locations)</strong>: amazing quality given that it‚Äôs a local chain. Loved by locals.<br />
<strong>Karina‚Äôs ceviche</strong>: I was so sad we discovered this late in the game‚Ä¶only got to go once. Gelato around the corner!</p>

<h3 id="convoy-because-it-is-its-own-section">Convoy (because it is its own section)</h3>
<p><strong>Koon Thai</strong>: Amy went with Tess for noodle soups. I got to come along once‚Ä¶<br />
<strong>Boiling Passion</strong>: Hot pot, on a stick! We got ‚Äúregular‚Äù and I am ashamed to say, it was in fact too spicy.<br />
<strong>Little Sheep hot pot</strong>: Simple chain restaurant but good.<br />
<strong>Raki Raki Ramen</strong>: Ok but not as memorable as you might think from the reviews. Oxtail soup was good.<br />
<strong>Cauldron Ice cream</strong>: Fun, gimmicky ice cream (liquid nitrogen).<br />
<strong>Shan Xi Magic Kitchen</strong>: Noods and dumps!<br />
<strong>Manna Korean BBQ</strong>: If you‚Äôre coming with Turkish people, be ready: it‚Äôs a competitive sport and they play to win.</p>

<h3 id="other">Other</h3>
<p><strong>Regent‚Äôs Pizza (UTC)</strong>: Excellent beer selection, delicious pizza, often busy.<br />
<strong>International Market (UTC)</strong>: the most charming old man works the grill. Kebabs, salads, and Persian groceries.<br />
<strong>Red Sea Ethiopian</strong>: Hole in the wall with slow service and inconsistent food. But charming and delicious! Amy, Avi, and   Rie‚Äôs regular spot when I was out of town. Recommend sticking to the vegetarian items.<br />
<strong>Phil‚Äôs BBQ</strong>: Brett (our resident BBQ professor) insists this is the best thing ever. Delicious ribs, family friendly.</p>
