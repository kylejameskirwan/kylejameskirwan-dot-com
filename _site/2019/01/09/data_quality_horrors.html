  <p>Names, genders, timestamps, and column names have all been modified to protect the identities of the victims. The storylines are, sadly, very real.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Noncents</h2>

<p>An analyst was developing a dashboard. For some reason all the USD numbers on the dashboard were whole: none of them had any cent values. After much upstream-sleuthing, he discovered that the column the transaction amounts were coming from had type set to INTEGER.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Down and to the right</h2>

<p>The product analytics manager was woken at 2:00AM by his teamâ€™s product manager. The dashboard tracking growth in India showed a precipitous drop in their key engagement metric.</p>

<p>The analytics manager woke his team mate who had built the dashboard. While debugging over Slack (now at 3:00-something AM) they realized that an upstream ETL was failing, and their aggregate table had only partially populated, simulating a sudden drop in business.</p>

<p>They kicked the ETL job and went back to bed.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Append-icitus</h2>

<p>The ETL that ingested the source CSV adds an additional <code>etl_timestamp</code> column when writing to its destination table. An analyst had added a <code>config_type</code> column to the schema of the CSV at some point, pushing this <code>etl_timestamp</code> column further to the right. The next ETL in the pipeline was not resilient to schema changes, and was now using the new <code>config_type</code> column as if it were a timestamp.</p>

<p>Right data, wrong column.</p>
