<h2 id="build-my-exercise-baseline">Build my exercise baseline.</h2>
<p>I did more (deliberate) exercise in 2019 than I ever have (including my first 5k!), but it was in fits and spurts.</p>

<p>In 2020 I want to establish a baseline of regular exercise including both cardio and strength every week.</p>

<h2 id="take-toro-to-the-next-stage">Take Toro to the next stage.</h2>
<p>In 2019 I moved Toro from, essentially, just a concept, to the beginnings of an actual business. Egor and I started from scratch, built and iterated on an MVP product, found our early adopters, raised seed capital, and started hiring.</p>

<p>In 2020 I want to use the fresh fuel in the tank to build a great business. A great business means: a product that effectively solves the pain our customers are feeling, a strong team that can build and sell that product, and most importantly, a growing network of customers who love working with us.</p>

<h2 id="travel-again">Travel again.</h2>
<p>2018 was a year of relocating: from Seattle to San Diego and from there to New York. It never felt like Amy and I had any capacity except for a few tango events, two weddings, and family holiday time.</p>

<p><em>Exception: The Torres Del Paine W loop was amazing and I’m so glad I said yes to that trip (though I want to go back someday when Amy is ready for the two steep sections).</em></p>

<p>In 2020 I want to plan a few real trips (not just long weekends) to new places. Importantly: they don’t need to be backpacking or pushing my physical limits, just getting out there and enjoying the time spent somewhere new. Bonus points if we rondezvous with friends!</p>

<h1 id="little-goals">Little Goals</h1>
<ul>
  <li>Eating more fish and vegetables, less land protein.</li>
  <li>DJ for tango more often. Starting small with local events, but regularly (monthly?). Bonus points if I do anything outside of NYC or SF.</li>
  <li>Read more (I did read significantly more in 2019 but let’s keep going).</li>
  <li>Deliberately lengthen my continuous attention span.</li>
  <li>Set up regular donations to things I care about: Wikipedia, KEXP, ACLU, EFF?</li>
  <li>Getting outside regularly again to hike, camp, and backpack.</li>
</ul>
