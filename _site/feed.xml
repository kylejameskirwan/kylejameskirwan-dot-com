        <description>&lt;p class=&quot;lead&quot;&gt;Rock climbing&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;My first time top roping in a long time. We went to Mission Cliffs where I &lt;em&gt;almost&lt;/em&gt; aced the belay test. I forgot how to check my double figure eight knot (look for 5 sets of parallel lines). I climbed some 5.10d's and a 5.11a. It was a good wake up call that bouldering focuses on very different strengths.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;lead&quot;&gt;A walk&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Megan and I walked 9 miles in one day. We hit Buena Vista, Corona Heights, and Sutro Open Space Preserve. I was fortunate enough to have Apple Pay set up on my phone so we could buy something to drink in Cole Valley, as I forgot my wallet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;lead&quot;&gt;Reading Kafka&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I borrowed &lt;em&gt;The Trial&lt;/em&gt;, by F. Kafka, from my friend George. I was surprised to have covered 70 pages in one day (the book is ~250). I've been mixing paperback (Hillbilly Elegy) and Kindle books (The Innovator's Dilemma) recently. Each format has different qualities to appreciate.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Driving Death Valley</title>
        <description>&lt;p class=&quot;lead&quot;&gt;November, 2016&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;We drove into Death Valley in a rented Jeep, with two friends in the back, and 2 more in their own truck (an FJ).&lt;/p&gt;

Megan kept us happy with her ukelele on the way through Tahoe. From there we headed down along past Mono Lake and eventually into the valley.&lt;/p&gt;

Sunset near a lake. We had to decide whether to make camp here, or head further up toward the Lippincott Mine road, which would take us to Racetrack the next day. We decided to press on.&lt;/p&gt;

We hiked in this canyon on the last day before heading out. We got back out just as rain started coming down -- something we didn't want to be in the canyon for.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Tilden Little Farm</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;We went to a little farm in Berkeley called Tilden Little Farm. You can bring your own lettuce or celery and feed the animals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/83326/kylejameskirwan.com_rsources/photography/000052490031.jpg&quot; class=&quot;image-big&quot;&gt; These cows had long tongues which reach out to take the lettuce from your hands.&lt;/p&gt;
