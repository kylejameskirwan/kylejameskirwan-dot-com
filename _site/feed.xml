				<title>Tilden Little Farm</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;We went to a little farm in Berkeley called Tilden Little Farm. You can bring your own lettuce or celery and feed the animals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/83326/kylejameskirwan.com_rsources/photography/000052490031.jpg&quot; class=&quot;image-big&quot;&gt; These cows had long tongues which reach out to take the lettuce from your hands. I caught this one mid-chew. Obviously made a mistake with my depth-of-field. I think this was at f1.2 or f1.4, and should have been higher.&lt;/p&gt;
