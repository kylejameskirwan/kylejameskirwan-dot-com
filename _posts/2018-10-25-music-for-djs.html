This is a dump of the notes I took during a DJ seminar given by a well respected west coast DJ several years ago. I hope to come back and clean them up, but here they are as they were written.

# Class One - Musical Quality  

### Positioning of the beat Emphasis
End (like the bando) vs beginning (piano) 
Emphasis of the beat can be used to build families of tango sounds 
x = energy, y = rythm 

Street band

* Centered emphasis
* Loose, sweet feeling 
* Canaro, Victor, Lomuto 
* *El Adios (Canaro) for example*

Driving

* Forward emphasis
* Feels pushy, tight, angry
* DArienzo, Biagi, some Troilo  

Refined

* Rear emphasis
* Feels laggy, elegant, and melancholy
* DAgostino, Di Sarli, Fresedo  

Exploratory

* Extremely late emphasis
* Stretchy, virutosic, angsty
* De Caro, Pugliese, some Laurenz

#### The Backbone
Calo: Refined  
DiSarli: Centered  
Troilo: Driving, Exploratory  
Pugliese: Exploratoy  
DArienzo: Driving  
Canaro: Street Band  

#### Side Players  
DAgostino  
De caro  
Biagi  
Rodriguez  
Lomuto  
Fresedo  
DAngelis: hard to place, sometimes multiple styles even in same song  
Demare: Refined, Exploratory  

### Equipment
#### Speaker positioning
Speakers should be above head height   
Should be along the long end of the floor so sound is distributed  
Pointed slightly in  

#### Mixer  
Keep your sound levels all below 75% (source? Research this)  
Make sure bass isnâ€™t turned up  

#### Volume  
Check volume on floor frequently  
Before you start, check for loud or quiet areas  
Watch number of dancers, sound will be muffled if there are a lot of dancers   

#### Equalizer  
Many of the pops and scratches on are on the higher frequencies  
Most of the song data is in the midranges

# Class Two - Music and Space

### Last week's topics  
* where the emphasis lies on the beat
* mapping the orchestras
* talked about emotional content linked to type of sound
* key instruments
    + streetband - bass, low tones of violins, focus on keeping the beat
    + exploratory - bando
    + refined - piano
    + driving - bando(?)

### How to put these classifiers to work

Group songs with a similar sound so dancers know what they can expect.
Dancers can pair based on what emotion they want to express given the theme of the tanda.

### The Role of the DJ

To help the dancers express the music.  
To have them leave the floor feeling confident.  
Keeping a balance so that everyone has something to dance to.  
Sequencing the songs in a way that flows and feels sensible.  
To bring them through key musical areas so they feel the entire range of "the milonga experience".   
To keep the early dancers happy even while warming up the dancers who arrive later.  

### Thinking about the tanda

A song is the atomic unit.  
A tanda is the molecule.  
Each atom has a specific feeling to contribute to the molecule.  
The tanda should elicit a specific feeling which grows and progresses from song 1 to 4.  
Each tanda needs to fit the flow of the night, blending smoothly from the previous one and into the next.  

### Tanda Skeleton

**Song 1**  
Very familiar / well known  
Draws dancers to the floor  
*El Cencerro*  
*Pensalo Bien*  
*Tristeza Marina*  
*Vamos*  
*Araca La Cana*  
*Adios Buenos Aires*  

**Song 2**  
Well known, almost on par with song 1  
Danceable but not appropriate for beginning or ending  
*Gorriones*  
*Caero Al As*  
*Sencillo y Compadre*  

**Song 3**  
Less familiar, good place to experiment (slightly)  
Continues or revises direction  
Higher energy than song 2  

**Song 4**  
Also very familiar 
Highest energy  
Has a strong ending, can feature a varacion or a nice vocal  
Makes them feel confidence and lets them express their emotion    
*El Recodo (might be a good opener, but too powerful, nothing could go up from here)*  
*Dime Mi Amor (voice at the end is nice)*  
*La Capilla Blanca (slow down at the end doesn't affect any "next song")*  
*Patetico (nice variacion)*  

### Things to think about
* The start and the end are the most important, people remember these
    + primacy and recency effect in psychology
* Familiarity and variety should be balanced
    + too many familiar songs is boring and tired
    + too much variety is bothersome, even if all the songs are danceable
    + the middle of the set is a good place to introduce less known music
    + listening to your collection TOO MUCH may throw off your feeling of what is familiar within the community
* Guide the change in energy within the tanda
    + should travel in a specific direction - the goal of the tanda
    + the intensity of the direction should increase over the tanda, not fall
    + direction can be romance, intensity, virtuosity, etc
    + does not ALL need to be moving upward, but last two should
    + could go down on the second song (forms a checkmark shape)
* Don't get in the way of the tanda being danceable just to explore as a DJ
* Don't leave a slow ending on a song in the middle, it will interfere with the next song's energy
* Same singer & orchestra is usually best
    + changing will alert some dancers, taking them out of the moment
    + can change orchestras if there's a very specific reason
    + can mix instrumental / vocal (vocal often has higher intensity)
* Varacion usually in Song 4 but can be in others if they feel right
* Watch out for songs involving soccor in the lyrics, can be distracting to spanish speakers

## The SuperTanda
The molecular chain  
TTM or TTV - As a unit, lower energy tango to higher energy tango

## Space - The Ronda
Rectangle provides opportunity for different movement based on side length  
Square can feel more consistent to some dancers  
Permeate tables to allow more entry / exit points


## How to watch the room
Blur your vision and perceive the flow, are there big gaps or concentrations?  
If people are focused on specific musical elements or movements too much, it suggests they aren't feeling the music and their partner enough.  
D'Arienzo: forces them to adhere to the beat  
Pugliese / Podesta: allows them to focus inward and on each other  
Watch for temperature  
*If the room is hot, don't make them move enough to heat it up more*  
*If the room is cold, make them move around and warm it up*  

***

## Homework for Class 3
Choose 3 songs that represent tandas
Build a SuperTanda and justify it (TTM or TTV)

***

# Class Three - The Supertanda

Example tanda - builds rythmic intensity  
*Dejame Ser Asi - Llorar por una mujer - Danza Maligna - En la buena y la mala*

Example tanda - builds melodic emotional intensity  
*Tristeza Marina - Decime que paso - Charlemos - Griseta*  

Bad Example tanda - nice songs but doesn't feel like it progresses  
*A Quien La Puede Importar - Esta Noche en Buenos Aires - Gorriones - El Yacare*

Bad Example tanda - "wakes up" the dancers  
*Santa Milonguita - Trago Amargo - Infamia - Dime mi amor*  

* Switches singer, recodring quality, pianist
* This is ok to do as long as the voices are similar
* Tanturri, Troilo, Di Sarli should be left alone
* Mixing Beron might be dicey

**Listen to the first and last song to check that there's a progression**

**Listen to the entire song, they might get weird halfway in - A Pan y Agua**

## Role of the DJ - Revisted

Facilitate the "milonga experience"  
Curating the experience through the music  

1.  Drawing dancers to the floor - Grab a sitter and make them dance with you to break the ice
2. Helping the dancers express the music
3. Helping them navigate through the night, including the change in skill level as the night progresses - Easy / danceable early - gooey center - touching the musical corners toward the end
4. Help them feel the music deeply, focusing on an instrument or sound  

#### RULE: Don't get in the way of the dancers, you're a step ahead of them but not controlling them  

Having supertandas built is helpful  
Example: *Di Sarli / Rufino -> Laurenz / Casas*

## Crafting the flow

### The three flows

1. Tanda
2. Supertanda
3. The entire night

### Tools

1. Sequence of songs and orchestras
2. Energy reset
3. Pattern: TTVTTM TTVTM TTTVM
    + Use these to control partner change frequencies
    + TTVTM will encourage faster rotation
4. Palate cleanser: chacarrera / salsa / swing
    + Only a good idea if enough people will actually dance it

### Energy level flow

Compare a sawtooth energy pattern with a sinusoidal one  
Sawtooth: doesn't allow for pallate cleansers  

T1 T3 V5 T2 T4 M6

#### TT Pairs  
DiSarli/Rufino -> Laurenz/Casas : Increasing strechiness  
Fresedo -> Troilo : Rythmic playfulness (gentle to more gripping)  

Crossing musical families between sets allows you to differentiate the adjacent sets  
Avoid repeating musical familes (Canaro -> OTV would be too much)  
Alternating rythmic melodic within the supertanda covers your dancers tastes better  

Think about the thread between tango 1,2 and 4,5

#### Range of emotions
Should be tighter in the beginning for newer dancers or people who just arrived  
Should get wider toward the end to fill more of the milonga experience   

Notes:  
Canaro doesn't work pre-milonga, not enough build  
DiSarli/Podesta into a Biagi would be too abrupt  
No vals after a DiSarli/Podesta - they're too swirly and round (abrupt)

#### Cortinas
They should inspire motion, but in a vague way - Don't suggest swing / salsa  
Should follow the previous tanda to prevent ruining the embrace-feeling they had  
Length based on how long it will take the floor to clear (20s - 70s)C

#### Changing the pattern
Last 30 minutes, or some defining point, she stops playing milongas and valses, just varies the energy levels of tangos  
Reduces rotation and enhances flow

## Ending notes
Disabling trackpad-touch-to-click or bringing a mouse  
Build double the sets you need for the time  
Mixing - Saca chispas only good decaro milonga, has to be mixed with others  
Tanda placards - nice but if you use them make sure you actually use them
