Another list of things I'd recommend to others (with a few extras from Amy that I haven't been to myself). This one is overdue: I lived in San Diego from February to June this year and am only getting around to writing about it now.  

### Fish
__Musashi's (UTC)__ (shout out to Jackson, who made every meal feel like visiting family): changed our lives for five months. So so thankful this spot exists. An extension of Musashi's Seattle with generous portions of delicious fish for very reasonable prices.  
__El Pescador (La Jolla)__: delicious fishes served by people who look like they'd rather be surfing.  
__Suhsi Ota__: very traditional atmosphere and food, well done.  
__Himitsu__: non-traditional! Interesting preparations and a nice foil to Ota. Pricey. No tamago ‚òπÔ∏è  

### Coffee and tea
__Bird Rock (La Jolla) (and downtown)__: A fantastic coffee roaster. Great place to sit and slow down.  
__Philz (UTC)__: full of students studying. A Mint Mojito in the afternoon is a good thing. No espresso here.  
__Copa Vida (Wesley what up!)__: quieter than Philz, but still mostly students studying.  
__Caffe Calabria (North Park)__: Amy went here all the time with Avi for coffee. Pizza good too!  
__Cafe Bassam (Balboa Park)__: old world feel  

### Breweries
__Stone__: the Disneyland of beer. Seminal location for the craft beer industry.  
__Ballast Point__: home of Sculpin, one of my favorite IPAs (as well as some notably delicious stouts).  
__Border X Brewing (Barrio Logan)__: nice brews but come for the fantastic tacos in the back. Enjoyed this on an art night when the street was crowded.  
__Modern Times__: bustling brewery on weekends with solid beer.  

### Bars
__Tiger Tiger! (North Park)__: Slightly grungy. Home of the famous Man Hour. Get a beer and a brat (and Raj's phone number).  
__False Idol (this is Amy's suggestion. I never got to go! üò§)__: because any tiki bar with any relation to Martin Cate is a must-do in my book.  
__Panama 66 (Balboa Park)__: Outdoor seating, beer and cocktails. There was live jazz just within earshot. Perfect.  
__Prohibition__: speakeasy style bar. Because it's in the bar/club district, the clientele can be uncivilized (only speakeasy I've been to where I overheard someone *try* to order an appletini), but can be worth a visit.  

### Tacos, Ceveche, and the like
__Taco Stand (several locations)__: amazing quality given that it's a local chain. Loved by locals.  
__Karina's ceviche__: I was so sad we discovered this late in the game...only got to go once. Gelato around the corner!

### Convoy (because it is its own section)
__Koon Thai__: Amy went with Tess for noodle soups. I got to come along once...  
__Boiling Passion__: Hot pot, on a stick! We got "regular" and I am ashamed to say, it was in fact too spicy.  
__Little Sheep hot pot__: Simple chain restaurant but good.  
__Raki Raki Ramen__: Ok but not as memorable as you might think from the reviews. Oxtail soup was good.  
__Cauldron Ice cream__: Fun, gimmicky ice cream (liquid nitrogen).  
__Shan Xi Magic Kitchen__: Noods and dumps!  
__Manna Korean BBQ__: If you're coming with Turkish people, be ready: it's a competitive sport and they play to win.  

### Other
__Regent's Pizza (UTC)__: Excellent beer selection, delicious pizza, often busy.  
__International Market (UTC)__: the most charming old man works the grill. Kebabs, salads, and Persian groceries.  
__Red Sea Ethiopian__: Hole in the wall with slow service and inconsistent food. But charming and delicious! Amy, Avi, and   Rie's regular spot when I was out of town. Recommend sticking to the vegetarian items.  
__Phil's BBQ__: Brett (our resident BBQ professor) insists this is the best thing ever. Delicious ribs, family friendly.
