What makes tango so addictive

Many people who dance tango regularly describe it as an addiction. People travel cross-country or to far away to dance late into the night, push their bodies to the point of exhaustion or pain, and spend thousands on festival tickets, classes, meals, and clothing.

Tango is addictive because it combines so many things that humans enjoy doing. It creates an everlasting challenge with many dimensions to progress in, it's a social activity that gives you space to talk to and physically contact others, it includes music which is naturally enjoyable to most people, and it gives dedicated chunks of time to express different emotions ranging from silliness to frustration to a feeling of loss.


==Depth of the challenge==
Each of these will be more or less important to different dancers, but here are some areas that a dancer will explore as they build their skill in the dance. Many of these areas take hundreds or thousands of hours to become proficient in, and in many of them you can always push further into greater refinement or broadening. I've met people who have danced for decades, perform at national events, and teach students, who are still discovering new things about their bodies or about movement or something else, sometimes from unexpected sources like tai chi or listening to totally unrelated music.

* Basic physical movement alone
* Basic physical movement with a partner
* Feeling comfortable to your partner
* Knowledge of the music allowing you to hear and express it more fully
* Ability to improvise and react to the music and to your partner's movement
* Learning to build small movements together into more complex expressions
* Ability execute the same set of movements but with different expressions...long and stringy, quick and stocatto, etc.
* Ability to dance well with different people who each feel and move differently
* Looking good to onlookers


==Direct feedback between effort and reward==
Investing hours into the dance almost always pays out in improvement. Early on these will be bigger steps, and later they will become smaller and smaller improvements, but the practicioner's eye will also be more able to tell the difference, so the rewards are still appreciated.

* Drilling on your existing movements to refine them
* Learning new movements or patterns of movement
* Learning more music, or hearing new things in music you already know
* Learning tricks, rules, or improvements to how you interact with others


==Teamwork==
There's the famous phrase, and it's true. When you and a partner push yourselves to do something difficult, you share a sense of shared success when it goes well, you can laugh off the failed attempt together, or at least have someone to discuss what worked and what didn't. If one of you needs to be helped, emotionally, warming up, whatever, you go through that with a partner who hopefully is supporting you when you need it. It can also feel good to be the supporter for someone else. The same is true for an advanced dancer dancing with a someone less experienced: it can be frustrating if you try to dance at a level above what the other person is ready for, but rewarding when you feel you're working with the other person at their level to make the dance enjoyable.

There's also the more delicate teamwork between you as a couple, and between the other couples nearby. You're all moving together in the same space, and it takes good coordination between couples to alot each couple enough space to express yourselves, while minimizing the amount of distraction this requires. For this reason, sometimes leaders who know one another will form a "train" because they know the dancers ahead and behind them are easy to dance near.


==Social bonds==
It's naturally to progressively make friends
Some are distant but who you see in random places in the world
Some are close and you treasure
You're tapped into a diverse network of people, different locations, languages, interests, professions, ages


==Physical contact==
Humans enjoy contact, both friendly and sensual. Tango gives you repeat opportunities to enjoy these to different degrees with different people. This can be two friends dancing with a reasonable distance between each other, maybe even breaking contact, being silly and having fun. On the other end, it can be two people feeling totally immersed in the presence of their partner, not breaking contact at all. When the 3 or 4 songs are over, either of these cases could just as easily dissolve and the partners are individuals again who give a quick hug and might not even talk again for months.

You can experience these extremes, or more often something in between, with people you see every Tuesday, or with strangers you can't even speak to because you lack a common language.


==Emotional release==
Gives you predefined moment in time where you can experience some feeling...can be silly hapiness, melancholy, frustration
Not just safe to emotionally express yourself, it's one of the goals for many people
When the set is over, you can relax, let those feelings dissipate, and return to "normal"


==Music==
Humans love music
There's a wealth of good music that's been built up
The music has a lot of depth, you can listen to the same 200-300 songs for 10, 20+ years without getting tired of it
