A list of nice things I discovered in my one year living in Seattle. Updated on 2020-01-02.

### Coffee/tea
__KEXP__ (bottom of Queen Anne) is an amazing open space to sit and read, work, or chat. You can watch the live KEXP DJ and get great coffee from the resident shop (was La Marzocco at the time).  
__Vivace__ (Capital Hill) One of the makers of 3rd wave coffee in the US. Phenomenal espresso drinks, old-school feel.  
__Stumptown__ (southern Capital Hill) What can I say, I love Stumptown in Portland and this is the closest thing in Seattle.  
__Miro tea__ (Ballard) Delicious tea and soothing atmosphere.  
__Milstead & Co.__ (Fremont) New-school feel.  
__Storyville__ (all over) Nice coffee, but read about “Mars Hill Church” before going (or not going).  
__Starbucks Reserve Tasting Room__ (Capital Hill) Very unique (and large) space with some drinks you can't get at any other Starbucks.  

### Bars
__Canon__ (Capital Hill) Over the top, but so well done.  
__Zigzag__ An ancient Seattle location (bartender moved to Canon?)  
__Rob Roy__  My favorite spot for waiting for seat at Shiro’s.  
__Navy Strength__ Solid Tiki.  

### Pizza
__Masonry__ (bottom of Queen Anne) Great pizza and greater beer.  
__Patxi’s__ (Ballard) Ordered deep dish from here when I needed some Hayes Valley comfort.  
__Sizzle Pie__ (Capital Hill) Grungy, good.  

### Ramen
__Danbo__ (Capital Hill) Lots of choices. A good bowl of noodles.  
__Arashi__ (Ballard) Fairly traditionla izakaya style place.  

### Tacos
__Chukis__ (Capital Hill) Al pastor with pineapple on top, a Tecate, perfect.  
__Neon Taco__ (Capital Hill) Some interesting menu items, but a great spot for a taco and a beer.  

### Sushi
__Musashi’s__ (Wallingford) Cheap, good, great portions.  
__Shiro’s__ (Belltown) Pricey but nice omakase. Relaxed atmosphere.  
__Kashiba__ (Belltown) Where you can actually find Shiro. Very-pricey but very-nice...  
__Menaki__ (ID/Chinatown) Great family-run Japanese (not sushi), cheap!  

### Farmers markets
Queen Anne Thursdays (June-Oct only)  
U-District on Saturdays  
Ballard on Sundays  

### Misc
__Kerry Park__ (Queen Anne) famous view, 2 blocks away  
__SIFF Cinema__ (bottom of Queen Anne) is fun  
__Panda Lab__ (bottom of Queen Anne) For developing film  
__Volunteer Park__ (Capital Hill) Has a Noguchi sculpture (which inspired a Soundgarden song)  
__Elliott Bay Book Co.__ (Capital Hill)  
__Cafe Presse__ (Capital Hill) Great lunch spot.  
__Uneeda Burger__ (Fremont) For when you just need a burger and a beer.    
__No Bones Beach Club__ Vegetarian, fun, beach/tiki themed.  
__Shake Shack__ Downtown (Because sorry, Seattle, but Dick’s is…not good).  
__Jade Garden__ (ID/Chinatown) for dim sum.  
__Tune Hi-fi__ (Belltown) Nice people, care about audio.
