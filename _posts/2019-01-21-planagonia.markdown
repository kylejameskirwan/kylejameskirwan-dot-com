# Getting to the park
1. Fly into Santiago, Chile
2. 3.5 hour connecting flight from Santiago to Punta Arenas, Chile
3. 3 hr bus ride to Puerto Natales, book tix in advance
4. 2.5hr bus ride from Puerto Natales into park, book tix in advance, take the 7AM bus to avoid lines and be able to hike same day

# Route
# Misc notes
- Wanna do Britanico, winds at Frances discouraging but worth the view
- Check weather before morning hike to Base Torres, is a 6-9hr hike and can be not worth it if bad weather
- Hiking West to East builds in difficulty and beauty
- East to West: “The main benefit of this route is you get to do the hardest day without your heavy pack (if you are staying at refugios and not carrying much then this route isn't for you).”

# Difficulty quotes
Can lose boots crossing river in knee-high water

> One person even had a panic attack on the trail and had to be closely guided by two strangers

> much less tiring than we anticipated -- granted we spent all summer training in the Cascades, which I'm sure helped.

> My party literally had to crouch and hug the ground at times in order to not to be blown downhill.  

> I have hiked a lot through Yosemite and the W is comparable to anything you’ll see there. The big difference is you have to earn the W!
