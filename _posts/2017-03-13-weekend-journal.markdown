<p class="lead">Rock climbing</p>
My first time top roping in a long time. We went to Mission Cliffs where I *almost* aced the belay test. I forgot how to check my double figure eight knot (look for 5 sets of parallel lines). I climbed some 5.10d's and a 5.11a. It was a good wake up call that bouldering focuses on very different strengths.

<p class="lead">A walk</p>
Megan and I walked 9 miles in one day. We hit Buena Vista, Corona Heights, and Sutro Open Space Preserve. I was fortunate enough to have Apple Pay set up on my phone so we could buy something to drink in Cole Valley, as I forgot my wallet.

<p class="lead">Reading Kafka</p>
I borrowed *The Trial*, by F. Kafka, from my friend George. I was surprised to have covered 70 pages in one day (the book is ~250). I've been mixing paperback (Hillbilly Elegy) and Kindle books (The Innovator's Dilemma) recently. Each format has different qualities to appreciate.
