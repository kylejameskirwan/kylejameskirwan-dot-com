They probably work well for flat terrain, but dragging it up 1000ft of gain in a day was painful.

It's 2 stories tall, but this was all you could see sticking out.

Fortunately it was well stocked with firewood, candles, and canned food.

Going downhill with the pulk was easier...but I still wouldn't have brought it.
