I moved my blog from GitHub Pages to Vercel a few weeks ago. I'm not a developer, so these kinds of technical projects usually get put on the "someday" list indefinitely. This time I had help from Warp, which is basically an AI that lives in your terminal.

## What actually happened

Warp automated most of the work I would have struggled with. Instead of me spending hours figuring out configuration files and deployment commands, I just described what I wanted to do and let it handle the details.

The AI took care of:
- Setting up the vercel.json config file
- Running the right Jekyll build commands  
- Managing the actual deployment process
- Walking through the DNS setup

What I liked most: I could supervise what it was doing at each step. It would show me what it was about to do, explain why, then execute. If something looked wrong, I could stop and ask questions. Much better than blindly copy-pasting commands from Stack Overflow.

## The results

**Better builds:** Vercel builds are much faster and more reliable.

**Analytics:** GitHub Pages gives you basically nothing. Vercel shows me which posts people actually read, where they're coming from, page load speeds, etc.

**Actually got it done:** This project had been on my list for months. Having automated help made it something I could tackle in an afternoon instead of putting off forever.

## Worth trying

If you've been putting off some technical project because it seems too complicated, AI tools like this are genuinely helpful. They can do the tedious work while you focus on the decisions that matter.
