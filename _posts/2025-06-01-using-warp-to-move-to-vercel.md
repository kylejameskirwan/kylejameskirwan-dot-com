I recently transitioned my blog from GitHub Pages to Vercel, seeking improvements like faster builds and enhanced analytics. While I'm not a developer, and the technical aspects of such migrations have been challenging for me in the past, this time I had the assistance of Warp, an AI terminal application.

## Streamlining the Migration

Warp helped automate many of the terminal tasks. This included setting up configuration files, running Jekyll build commands, and handling DNS configurations—all tasks that can typically consume a fair amount of time and effort if done manually. The process became more manageable, as it automated repetitive tasks, and I could focus on achieving the migration without wrestling with every detail.

## The Role of Automation

Warp didn't directly teach me coding skills, but it simplified the execution of essential terminal commands and package installations. This facilitation allowed me to tackle a project I had postponed for some time due to perceived complexity.

This is what I found most valuable: the AI didn't just give me copy-paste commands to run blindly. It explained the logic behind each decision, helping me build a mental model of how these deployment systems work together.

## The End Result

The site you're reading right now is now hosted on Vercel! The migration went smoothly, and I've gained both a functioning Vercel deployment and a better understanding of modern web deployment practices.

For anyone who's been on the fence about using AI tools for technical tasks they find intimidating, I can't recommend the experience enough. It's not just about getting things done faster—it's about making technical knowledge more accessible.
