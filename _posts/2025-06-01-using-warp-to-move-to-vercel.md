I've been hosting this blog on GitHub Pages for several years now, and while it's been reliable, I've been curious about trying out Vercel for a while. The promise of faster builds, better analytics, and more modern deployment options was appealing. But as someone who doesn't write code for a living, the technical aspects of migration have always been a bit daunting.

Enter Warp, the AI-powered terminal that's been making waves recently. I decided to give it a try for this migration project, and I'm still processing how mind-blowing the experience was.

## The Migration Process

With Warp's help, I was able to:

1. Set up the necessary configuration files for Vercel deployment
2. Configure the build process specifically for Jekyll
3. Add platform support for Linux to make the deployment work
4. Set up proper DNS configurations
5. Deploy the site to Vercel's global CDN

What would have normally taken me hours of googling, trial and error, and possibly reaching out to developer friends for help, took less than an hour with Warp guiding me through each step.

## AI Automation: A Non-Engineer's Perspective

As someone who doesn't code professionally, the most remarkable aspect was how Warp bridged the knowledge gap. When I hit roadblocks, the AI would not only suggest solutions but explain the reasoning behind them in terms I could understand.

For example, when we ran into issues with Ruby dependencies, Warp explained:

1. Why the problem was occurring
2. Multiple approaches to solving it
3. The pros and cons of each solution

This wasn't just about getting a task done—it was like having a patient mentor walking me through each step, helping me learn along the way.

## Learning Through Failures

Not everything went perfectly smooth. At one point, we ended up with a broken build configuration and needed to roll back to an earlier commit. But even this "failure" was valuable—Warp explained why the approach didn't work and what we could learn from it.

This is what I found most valuable: the AI didn't just give me copy-paste commands to run blindly. It explained the logic behind each decision, helping me build a mental model of how these deployment systems work together.

## The End Result

The site you're reading right now is now hosted on Vercel! The migration went smoothly, and I've gained both a functioning Vercel deployment and a better understanding of modern web deployment practices.

For anyone who's been on the fence about using AI tools for technical tasks they find intimidating, I can't recommend the experience enough. It's not just about getting things done faster—it's about making technical knowledge more accessible.
