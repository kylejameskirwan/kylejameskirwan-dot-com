<p class="lead">November, 2016</p>
We drove into Death Valley in a rented Jeep, with two friends in the back, and 2 more in their own truck (an FJ).

Megan kept us happy with her ukelele on the way through Tahoe. From there we headed down along past Mono Lake and eventually into the valley.

Sunset near a lake. We had to decide whether to make camp here, or head further up toward the Lippincott Mine road, which would take us to Racetrack the next day. We decided to press on.

We hiked in this canyon on the last day before heading out. We got back out just as rain started coming down -- something we didn't want to be in the canyon for.
