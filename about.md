<p class="lead">About this blog.</p>

I use this to recount my travels, dicuss thoughts relevant to my professional work, and show some of my photography. I use the <a href="http://github.com/gfjaru/Kiko">Kiko</a> theme for Jekyll.

<strong>I live in San Francisco</strong>, having moved here in 2013 from my home state, Florida, in 2013.

<strong>For work</strong>, I currently do product management at Uber, building internal data tools. I was a data scientist there between 2013 to 2016.

Prior to that I interned at Grooveshark, while doing undergrad in <a href="http://www.ise.ufl.edu">Industrial and Systems engineering</a> at the University of Florida.

<strong>For fun</strong>, I dance <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whnmaF8O_pI">Argentine Tango</a>, dabble in photography (both digital and film), go hiking and camping, and enjoy rock climbing (primarily indoor, both bouldering and top rope).

My girlfriend Megan writes about our travels and adventures over at <a href="https://beautimoose.wordpress.com">her own Wordpress blog</a>.
