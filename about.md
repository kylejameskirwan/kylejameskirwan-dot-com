This site is written by Kyle Kirwan.

I'm currently working at a startup focused on the next generation of data tooling called [Toro Data Labs](https://torodata.io). Our first product is a data validation tool called...Validation! Email me if you think your team could benefit from validating the data that powers your app features, ML models, ab-testing system, reports, dashboards...

Previously I was a data scientist and product manager at Uber, where I helped launch teams like [Experimentation Platform](https://eng.uber.com/xp/), and products like [Databook](https://eng.uber.com/databook/).

I'm using the <a href="http://github.com/gfjaru/Kiko">Kiko</a> theme for Jekyll.
