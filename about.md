Hi, I'm Kyle and this is my blog.

Originally from Florida, I moved to the West Coast in 2013. Since then I've lived in San Francisco, Seattle, and San Diego.

I'm a co-founder of [Toro Data Labs](https://torodata.io) -- we're building the next generation of great tools for data teams. Our first product is a data validation tool called...Validation! Email me (hello@torodata.io) if you think your team could benefit from validating the data that powers your app features, ML models, ab-testing system, reports, dashboards...

Previously I was a data scientist and then product manager at Uber, where I helped launch teams like [Experimentation Platform](https://eng.uber.com/xp/), and products like [Databook](https://eng.uber.com/databook/).

I'm using the <a href="http://github.com/gfjaru/Kiko">Kiko</a> theme for Jekyll.
