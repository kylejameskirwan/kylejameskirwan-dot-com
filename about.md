<p class="lead">About this blog.</p>

This is my place to recount travels, dicuss thoughts from my professional life, and exhibit some of my photography. The site is hosted via GitHub Pages, with a domain bought through Hover. I use the <a href="http://github.com/gfjaru/Kiko">Kiko</a> theme for Jekyll.

<strong>I live in San Francisco.</strong>

I moved in 2013 from Florida, on the suggestion of a close friend who had been living here already.

I traded my desktop computer for the one way ticket, borrowed some money from a friend in Orlando, and slept on an <a href="http://www.ikea.com/us/en/images/products/kivik-chaise-blue__0504255_PE633250_S4.JPG">Ikea Kivik</a> for 2 months while I job hunted. My offer letter from Uber arrived on the Wednesday before my budget-imposed last weekend. I will never regret dropping everything and moving with only what could fit in carry-on luggage to somewhere I'd never been before. Maybe I can try it again someday.

<strong>I work at Uber.</strong>

I'm a product manager in our data org, building internal data tools. I moved to product from data science, which I did here between 2013 and 2016. I'm fortunate to be working with some talented and experience people who I learn from every day.

Prior to Uber, I interned at Grooveshark, while completing undergrad in <a href="http://www.ise.ufl.edu">Industrial and Systems engineering</a> at the University of Florida.

<strong>For fun</strong>

I dance <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whnmaF8O_pI">Argentine Tango</a>, do amateur photography (digital and film), go hiking and camping, and enjoy rock climbing (primarily indoor, both bouldering and top rope).

My girlfriend Megan writes about our travels and adventures over at <a href="https://beautimoose.wordpress.com">her own Wordpress blog</a>.
