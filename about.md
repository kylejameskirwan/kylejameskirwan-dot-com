<p class="lead">About me.</p>

I previously worked as a data scientist and later as a product manager at Uber, often my writing relates to my career learnings.

Despite all the crowing about using "big data" and being "data driven", data is under-utilized in most industrial settings due to poor tooling or sloppy practices. A few common culprits are: poor planning and controls on schemas and how they evolve, little or no tracking of metadata, reluctance to structure warehoused data until as late in the game as possible, and laughably bad experimentation (read: ab testing) practices. Much of my work is focused on pushing the state of the art in these areas.

I also occassionally write about my hobbies including Argentine tango, and photography.

Thanks for reading! :)
