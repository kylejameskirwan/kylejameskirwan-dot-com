<p class="lead">About this blog.</p>

I use this to recount my travels, dicuss thoughts relevant to my professional work, and show some of my photography. The site is hosted via GitHub Pages, with a domain bought through Hover. I use the <a href="http://github.com/gfjaru/Kiko">Kiko</a> theme for Jekyll.

<strong>I live in San Francisco</strong>, having moved here in 2013 from my home state, Florida.

On the suggestion of a close friend who had been living here already, I traded my desktop computer in exchange for the one way ticket, borrowed some money from a friend in Orlando, and slept on an <a href="http://www.ikea.com/us/en/images/products/kivik-chaise-blue__0504255_PE633250_S4.JPG">Ikea Kivik</a> for 2 months while I job hunted. Everything I brought fit into one laptop bag, and one duffel bag.

It's been a real adventure so far, and I'm grateful for the help I got from everyone involved (James, Paul, Andrew, Stubbs, Pudge, ...).

<strong>I work at Uber</strong> as a product manager, building internal data tools. I moved into product from data science, which I did here between 2013 and 2016.

Before Uber, I interned at Grooveshark, while doing my undergrad in <a href="http://www.ise.ufl.edu">Industrial and Systems engineering</a> at the University of Florida.

<strong>For fun</strong>, I dance <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whnmaF8O_pI">Argentine Tango</a>, dabble in photography (both digital and film), go hiking and camping, and enjoy rock climbing (primarily indoor, both bouldering and top rope).

My girlfriend Megan writes about our travels and adventures over at <a href="https://beautimoose.wordpress.com">her own Wordpress blog</a>.
