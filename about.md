This site is written by Kyle Kirwan.

I'm currently working at a startup focused on the next generation of data tooling called [Toro Data Labs](https://torodata.io). Previously I was a data scientist and product manager at Uber.

I'm using the <a href="http://github.com/gfjaru/Kiko">Kiko</a> theme for Jekyll.
