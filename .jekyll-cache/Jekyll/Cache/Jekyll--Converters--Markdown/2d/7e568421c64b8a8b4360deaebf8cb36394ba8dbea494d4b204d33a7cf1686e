<h3 id="coffeetea">Coffee/tea</h3>
<p><strong>KEXP</strong> (bottom of Queen Anne) is an amazing open space to sit and read, work, or chat. You can watch the live KEXP DJ and get great coffee from the resident shop (was La Marzocco at the time).<br />
<strong>Vivace</strong> (Capital Hill) One of the makers of 3rd wave coffee in the US. Phenomenal espresso drinks, old-school feel.<br />
<strong>Stumptown</strong> (southern Capital Hill) What can I say, I love Stumptown in Portland and this is the closest thing in Seattle.<br />
<strong>Miro tea</strong> (Ballard) Delicious tea and soothing atmosphere.<br />
<strong>Milstead &amp; Co.</strong> (Fremont) New-school feel.<br />
<strong>Storyville</strong> (all over) Nice coffee, but read about ‚ÄúMars Hill Church‚Äù before going (or not going).<br />
<strong>Starbucks Reserve Tasting Room</strong> (Capital Hill) Very unique (and large) space with some drinks you can‚Äôt get at any other Starbucks.</p>
