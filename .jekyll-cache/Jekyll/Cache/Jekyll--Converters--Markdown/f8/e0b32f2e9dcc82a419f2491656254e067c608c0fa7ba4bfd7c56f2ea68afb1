Hi, Iâ€™m Kyle and this is my blog.</p>

<p>Originally from Florida, I moved to the West Coast in 2013. Since then Iâ€™ve lived in San Francisco, Seattle, and San Diego.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m a co-founder of <a href="https://torodata.io">Toro Data Labs</a> â€“ weâ€™re building the next generation of great tools for data teams. Our first product is a data validation tool calledâ€¦Validation! Email me (hello@torodata.io) if you think your team could benefit from validating the data that powers your app features, ML models, ab-testing system, reports, dashboardsâ€¦</p>

<p>Previously I was a data scientist and then product manager at Uber, where I helped launch teams like <a href="https://eng.uber.com/xp/">Experimentation Platform</a>, and products like <a href="https://eng.uber.com/databook/">Databook</a>.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m using the <a href="http://github.com/gfjaru/Kiko">Kiko</a> theme for Jekyll.</p>
